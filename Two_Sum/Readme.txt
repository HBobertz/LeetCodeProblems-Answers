This is the answer to a basic leetcode question; the two-sum problem. Here I will give you a random array of numbers, I want you to create a program that will go through this array of integers and find the first combination of integers that add to a target number I establish. If there are no integers that add together then I want you to return one string variable 'null'

Within the main.py there are a series of documentations along with the algorithm that we will use to figure this out. The method demonstrated is the brute force method that is robust but not efficent with big O notation.

Load up the main.py and see the answer and steps.
